# Prologue

The long planned family vacation to the Northern Lighs is close. It was distinct from the beginning that it will be a cruise. Everyone who would get to know of these plans would then immediately ask the one word question "Hurtigrouten?". The one word answer to it is "No.", the more elaborate is "No, we decided to go with AIDA primarily because of the easy arrival within Germany. Yes, I do believe that we will be spared the loud holiday club and party atmosphere like on Mallorca on this route."

The journey is called "Winter in the high North" and part of the travel operator's catalogue since 2017. You can read two travel reports in German here:

* [Winter im hohen Norden mit AIDAcara](https://www.thomasrenker.de/cruise/winter-im-hohen-norden-mit-aidacara-2017/)
* [Reisebericht: Nordlichter und Winter im hohen Norden mit AIDAcara](https://www.kreuzfahrtpiraten.de/reisebericht-winter-im-hohen-norden-mit-aidacara/)

## Hints

1. My notes have been unexpectedly evolved into a lengthy report (>5000 words) separated in several articles. You find a one page version [here](link://slug/norge2019page).
2. Initially some bullet points were written down to remember when filling out the AIDA feedback form but I left these here. I put these in a blue box.
3. Personal tips and side notes are put in an orange box.

!!! tip "AIDA feedback"
    ... is in this blue box.

!!! important "Anke's tips"
    ... look like this.
