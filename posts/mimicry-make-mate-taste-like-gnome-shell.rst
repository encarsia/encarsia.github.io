**GNOME Shell is an elegant desktop environment. I like its appearance, modern looks and the basic concepts of using it. Although I consider myself as a loyal (and/because lazy) user it's not perfect. After testing something in a VM running the Mate desktop I realized _how_ laggy it is on my machine so I decided to trick myself by making Mate behave like GNOME. Does it work?**
