**Knights of Ni - progress**

As `said before<link://slug/neues-projekt-knights-of-ni>`_ I am currently working on a GUI for `Nikola <https://getnikola.com>`_ doing some progress:

* removed titlebar, using headerbar instead
* switch between multiple Nikola instances
* bookmark local Nikola instances (only adding for now)
* support for multilinual sites:
    * display of configured languages
    * show existent translations in posts/pages tab
    * "Translation" tab: show files, generate new translation file for post/page (*this is somehow redundant to the posts/pages tab, I still think about it...*)
* if there is no title the "Title" column will show the slug or (if this does not exist neither) filename
* some mor log messages to pretent important things happen
