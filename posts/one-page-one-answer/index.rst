BER - Berlin Brandenburg Airport
    The first question touches a sore spot - Germany's most famous airport (BER). The construction project has been full of scandals involving mismanagement, patronage, bad planning, massive budget overrun and, of course, delay:

    `"Is the BER already open?" <http://www.istberschonoffen.de>`_ 

    or

    `"Has the BER been finished yet?" <http://www.istderberschonfertig.de>`_ with more sad details (German)

Friday?
    This is an easy one:

    `"Is it Friday?" <https://www.erdetfredag.dk/>`_ (Danish)

Traffic
    The third site answers the question whether the avenue behind the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin is closed for traffic (which often is the case due to public events like marathon, turn of the year or national ceremonies):

    `"Is the 17th of June Street closed?" <https://istdiestrassedes17tenjunigesperrt.de>`_ (German)
