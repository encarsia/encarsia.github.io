**JFTR: GoProTool v0.4 release**

Some minor changes/fixes for the `project <https://github.com/encarsia/gpt>`_. Recent development status is available as a (pre-)release: `Release v0.4 "scarlatina" <https://github.com/encarsia/gpt/releases/tag/v0.4>`_.

NEW:

- import files from any directory (and not just from detected SD cards) with corresponding button added to the toolbar

FIXED:

- folder selection on import
- progress status on video import

"FIXED":

- headerbar removed from the media preview version because no images on playback

.. note::

    This issue will probably be fixed by switching to LibVLC instead of GStreamer, see also `LibVLC tutorial article <link://slug/vlc-player>`__.
